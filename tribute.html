                    <h4>Amateur Carrier</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. He was raised in the family of billboard painter Cassius Clay Senior, along with his younger brother, Rudolph. Ali's first contact with boxing was due to Louisville policeman Joe E. Martin, who directed 12-year-old, going downhill, Cassius to the boxing room. Clay trains with local trainer Fred Stoner. Under Stoner, Cassius Clay won six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two Golden Gloves for national translation, national championship and finally, at the age of 18, a gold medal in the light heavyweight category at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. The balance of amateur fights is 100 wins and 5 losses.</p>
                    <p> 
                    <h4>The beginning of the profession</h4>
                            Zbigniew Pietrzykowski and Muhammad Ali, 1960
                        Immediately after winning the Olympic championship, Clay turned professional. He fought his first professional fight on October 29, 1960 with Tunney Hunsaker, winning on points. 
                            In the years 1960–1963 he fought a total of 19 fights, winning all, including 15 ahead of time. It was during this time that he met his future coach, Angelo Dundee.</p>
                    <h4>Winning the title</h4>
                    <p>
                        Ali won his first world title in 1964, at the age of 22, defeating then-champion Sonny Liston. Although Liston was the favorite (Cassius Clay was considered mostly strong with words), he gave up in the seventh round. After the fight, Cassius Clay ran around the ring screaming into the mics "I shook up the world" and "I am the greatest". Photos from the fight went around the world.</p>
                    <h4>Changing of name</h4>
                    <p>
                        After the fight, he officially joined the Nation of Islam, a radical organization of black Americans professing Islam led by Malcolm X and Ellijah Muhammad. He relinquished his surname Cassius Clay - initially his name was Cassius X. After Ellijah Muhammad nicknamed him "Ali," he took the surname Muhammad Ali.</p>
                    <h4>Next few years</h4>
                    <p>
                        Over the next two years, Ali successfully defended his title in fights, incl. with Floyd Patterson, German European Champion Karl Mildenberger, George Chuvalo, Henry Cooper, Brian London, Cleveland Williams, Ernie Terrell and Zora Folley.</p>
                    <p>
                        Ali was extremely fast, he provoked his opponents by lowering his arms during the fight and by a specific dance in the ring. The combination of legs called "Ali Shuffle" amazed not only the audience, but also the opponents themselves, who rarely could be cornered.</p>
                    <h4>Work ban 1967-1970</h4>
                    <p>W 1967 roku Ali został skazany na karę więzienia w zawieszeniu za odmowę służby wojskowej i wyjazdu na wojnę do Wietnamu. Skutkiem wyroku było odebranie paszportu, tytułu mistrza świata boksu oraz licencji profesjonalnego boksera. Przez trzy lata Ali nie mógł walczyć ani opuszczać terytorium USA. Zarabiał na życie jako propagator islamu, brał udział w reklamach, przedstawieniach telewizyjnych oraz teatralnych (wystąpił w musicalu Broadway jako Buck White). Jako bokser mógł stoczyć jedynie zainscenizowaną dla kamer walkę przeciwko wielkiemu poprzednikowi, byłemu mistrzowi świata w latach 1952–1956, Rocky’emu Marciano. W końcu, po procesie apelacyjnym, wyrok został uchylony. W roku 1970, gubernator stanu Georgia wydał zezwolenie na udział Alego w walce. 26 października w Atlancie Muhammad Ali powrócił na ring, wygrywając z Jerrym Quarrym w 3. rundzie przez TKO. Tego roku walczył jeszcze z Oscarem Bonaveną i pokonał go przez KO w 15. rundzie.</p>
                    <h4>First failures</h4>
                    <p>
                        
                        On March 8, 1971, Ali met Joe Frazier with a balance sheet of 26-0. The fight in Madison Square Garden between the two undefeated boxers was dubbed the "Duel of the Century" and remains in the annals of professional boxing to this day. In the final 15th round, Frazier won thanks to a point advantage (unanimous decision), thus breaking Ali's 31 consecutive wins.
                        
                        After another 10 wins in the years 1971–1973, including six ahead of schedule (he left George Chuvalo and Floyd Patterson in the defeated field), Ali met Ken Norton on March 31, 1973. Norton in this duel led to Ali's second defeat, breaking his jaw.</p>
                    <h4>Career peak</h4>
                    <p>
                        Half a year later, Ali repaid Norton by defeating him on points. After winning the rematch over another contender, Joe Frazier, in January 1974, he was able to take on the current all-weight world champion, George Foreman, and fight to regain the title. The fight, organized by Don King in the capital of Zaire, Kinshasa, was called "The Rumble in the Jungle". Ali adopted an unusual tactic in this meeting. Knowing that Foreman usually won by knockout in the first rounds, he stayed on the defensive for the first seven hits. He leaned against the ropes and took all Foreman's blows to his guard, rarely responding with straight blows. In the eighth round, Foreman was already extremely tired, then, completely unexpectedly, Ali attacked quickly, indisputably knocking out the champion.</p>
                    <h4>Friendship with Foreman</h4>
                    <p>
                        After the fight, both players became friends. The documentary When We Were Kings by Leon Gast won an Oscar in the Documentary Film category in 1996. During the award ceremony, both former adversaries appeared on the scene, with Foreman helping Ali, who had Parkinson's disease, to climb the stairs, illustrating the friendship between the athletes.
                        
                        Norman Mailer, who was among the journalists serving the meeting, wrote a book in 1975 entitled The Fight. Jethro Tull recorded the song "Bungle in the Jungle" in 1974, as did Fugees (with A Tribe Called Quest, Busta Rhymes and John Forté) - "Rumble in the Jungle".</p>
                    <h4>Career decline</h4>
                    <p>
                        On October 1, 1975, Don King organized Ali's next fight with great pomp, again in an exotic setting, this time in Manila, against Joe Frazier. After a murderous 14-round "Thrilla in Manila", played in extreme heat, Ali won because Frazier could not resume the fight (his eyes were so puffy that he couldn't see and his coach gave up the fight).
                        After three fights in 1976 (the last one ended ahead of time with Richard Dunn), Ali performed in a wrestling match with the master of this art, Antonio Inoki. After 15 rounds, the duel ended in a draw, but Ali suffered serious leg injuries. Then he fought 3 more victorious duels, including with old opponent Ken Norton. In February 1978, he lost the title to the 1976 Montreal Olympic champion Leon Spinks. It is true that he regained the title six months later, rematching Spinks, but it was his last victory. He announced his retirement on June 27, 1979, but returned in 1980, hoping to regain the title by fighting Larry Holmes. He did not make it to the end of the match, coach Dundee gave him up after 10 rounds. Also, Ali's last fight, on December 11, 1981 with Trevor Berbick, ended in a loss.
                        In 1984 he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.</p>
                    <h4>Death</h4>
                    <p> He died on June 3, 2016 as a result of septic shock, after a five-day stay in a hospital in Arizona, where he came with a respiratory infection [6]. He was buried at the local cemetery on June 10, 2016.</p>
